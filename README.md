### Title
Data processing library using SQL queries
### Abstract
Eighth version of programming language Java brought broad variety of changes, which strongly incline to declarative style of programming. In my thesis I have focused on using these changes in declarative ways of data processing on Java platform. I have decided on using Structured Query Language due to its declarativity Topic of my thesis was to create a library, which could interpret SQL queries. For interpretation, my library uses Streams and many other concepts which allow functional style of programming in Java. The most significant benefit of this library was giving alternative to programmers, who are looking for ways, how process data in application layer rather than on persistent layer.
